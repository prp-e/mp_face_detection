# Face Detection using MediaPipe

Classically, face detection in OpenCV was done using HAARCascade Classifiers. But most of my friends and also me, experienced and faced lots of problem with that old method. A while back, I have discovered a library called [MediaPipe](https://google.github.com/mediapipe) and done a bunch of research on the matter. So, I decided to work with the _Face_ module to get to a better face detection system.

This is a bit faster and a lot more presice comparing to that old method. I recommend using my way instead of the old way of doing face detection!

## TODO

- [x] Loading it on a Raspberry Pi
- [ ] Trying to match it to a security system
- [x] Trying with USB Webcam
- [ ] Trying with IP Camera
- [ ] Making it to a PyPi module
